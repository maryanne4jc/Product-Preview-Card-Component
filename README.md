I faced challenges in making the site responsive, and through this process, I learned more about handling responsive design and adapting layouts for various screen sizes.

### Continued development

In my future projects, I would like to practice using libraries such as Bootstrap and react.
I also plan to continue focusing on refining my responsive design skills and exploring more advanced CSS techniques. Additionally, I aim to delve into JavaScript to add interactivity to my future projects.
